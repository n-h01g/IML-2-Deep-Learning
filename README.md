### Project Details

In this project, I: 
- loaded an image dataset of flowers and created a pipeline;
- defined a new, untrained feed-forward network as a classifier;
- trained the image classifier on the dataset; 
- plotted the loss and accuracy values achieved during training for the training and validation set; and
- used the trained model to perform inference on the flower images.
